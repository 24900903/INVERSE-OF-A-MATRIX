# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix.
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
 1. Define the package as scipy.linalg import lu.
2. Get input from user and print L and U matrix by 'print'
3. Define a package as "from scipy.linalg import lu_factor lu_solve" and create the
variable as "x" include the package in that variable.
4. print the variable 'X'

## Program:
```python
Program to find the inverse of a matrix.

import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
res=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(res)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
